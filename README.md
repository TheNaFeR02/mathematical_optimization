# mathematical_optimization
Roadmap of my optimization course, links all the different projects about this topic, includes jupyter notebooks and all the different technologies (programming languages,libraries,...,) used in the course. 


- Taylor polynomials and convex sets/functions.
  - Taylor one dimensional problems.
  - Taylor in multiple variables and efficient representation of Gradients and Hessians.
  - Optimality conditions in multiple variables.

- Closed form expression for quadratic optimization problems.
- Lest square problems I
